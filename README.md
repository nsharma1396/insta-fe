# Frontend for running the Instagram clone (minimal)

Steps to run

1. Clone [insta-be](https://github.com/nsharma1396/insta-be) and run the back-end server as it serves the data for the front-end. (Steps for running the server are provided in the insta-be Readme.md)

2. Clone insta-fe.

2. Install all dependencies using:
```sh
yarn
```

OR

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run the server using the command:

```sh
yarn start
```

OR

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and will serve the profile route.
